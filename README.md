# Future Scope

- Having a larger sample size over an extended period allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the data and improves the ability to observe patterns and make reliable conclusions.

- A person could identify with more than one race/ethnicity. Finding a better way to represent and segregate the information is something we could work on.
